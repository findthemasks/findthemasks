        <ol>
            <li> Call your local hospital and ask to speak to the charge nurse.
            <li> Say what you have.
            <li> If they say they&rsquo;re fine, that&rsquo;s ok. Call back in a couple days.
            <li> If you are donating open packages, please put them in a ziploc bag with a note saying whether they have been used, whether anyone in your household has been sick or travelled outside the country, and the expiration date if known.
        </ol>
