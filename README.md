# findthemasks
Website for findthemasks.com

As of March 19 the most useful contribution is identifying more drop off
locations and plugging them into the form, so if you don't see an issue here
that calls to you, please work on that!

## Current setup
 - The website is just a static html file for now.
 - There is the start of a firebase directory structure,
   but that's not used to deploy the website. In the future
   hosting may be moved there.

## Thanks
 - The "Face With Medical Mask" favicon is used with thanks to
   [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/face-with-medical-mask/) which
   provides pre-generated favicon packages using
