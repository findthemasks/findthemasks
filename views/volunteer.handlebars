          <strong>#findthemasks</strong> is a global team of volunteers working to build a comprehensive database of PPE needs during the
          COVID-19 pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our global PPE needs map is interactive and constantly evolves in response to our recipients’ needs. We aim to
          add more usability around our data, and we welcome your thoughts and comments on how we can improve!

          Our Immediate Volunteer Needs:
        </h5>
        <!-- NOTE: just add "d-none" to the class of these divs to hide them !-->
        <div class="volunteer-needs translation d-none">
          <p>
            <strong>Translations</strong> - As we move into new countries, we need people who speak the official
            language(s) to help us check our translations, both for the web page and submission form. We have a machine
            translation tool implemented, but as you can imagine, the translations are occasionally off ("gown" should not
            become "dress” in another language :) ). We need your help to check translations and better support our global
            community!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="volunteer-needs tech">
          <p>
            <strong>Engineering & development</strong> - If you are a software engineer, QA engineer, UX/UI designer,
            product manager, data scientist, etc, we need your help:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You can find our Github <a href="https://github.com/findthemasks/findthemasks" target="_blank">here.</a>
            </li>
            <li>To setup your local dev environment, go <a
                href="https://github.com/findthemasks/findthemasks/blob/master/getting_started.md"
                target="_blank">here</a></li>
            <li>Join us on Slack! The link is in our GitHub readme</li>
            <li>Grab an issue! If you have any questions, message us on the #dev channel</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="volunteer-needs moderators d-none">
          <p>
            <strong>Moderators</strong> - All incoming data is moderated by a wonderful team of humans who vet and
            standardize the information in every PPE request. We receive a large volume of submissions, and our volunteer
            team of moderators would love your help! We provide ongoing training and support for all new moderators.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="volunteer-needs internationalization">
          <p>
            <strong>Internationalization</strong> - As we launch in new countries, we need help from local teams to tailor
            the mapping tool to every country. If you know a country (your country, perhaps!) that could use our tool, we
            would love your help to make it available to anyone in need.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="volunteer-needs outreach">
          <p>
            <strong>Outreach</strong> - Individual donors, makerspace communities, manufacturers and suppliers, other
            grassroots teams, and aid agencies all use our website to visualize how they can address PPE needs. Our
            outreach team connects with other groups so we can collaborate to close the gap between need and supply. They
            also develop new categories of healthcare providers and frontline workers that we can help support. If you are
            passionate about outreach, networking, and helping frontline workers gain visibility, join our outreach team!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="volunteer-needs social-media">
          <p>
            <strong>Social media</strong> - We need help staying connected and increasing our visibility through our
            social media platforms. Visibility helps new healthcare providers find us, and it helps our healthcare
            providers connect with more potential PPE contributors!
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          <strong>None of this would be possible without our volunteer community. Come join our team!</strong> If you’re interested, drop
          us a line and let us know what you’d like to work on!
