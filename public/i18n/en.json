  "ftm-faq-sites-non-medical-grade": "Why don't all sites allow non-medical grade items?",
  "ftm-faq-sites-non-medical-grade-answer-1": "As much as our recipients need PPE, they must also manage the risk incurred by using non-medical grade items. Many institutions do not have the resources to vet all of the contributions they receive from various donors, and some are more comfortable only using the medical-grade items that they are familiar with and know they can rely on.",
