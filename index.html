    <p class="addTopMargin">America&rsquo;s frontline healthcare workers are treating COVID19 patients without adequate protective gear, risking their lives! They have taken to Twitter on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GetMePPE&src=typeahead_click">#GetMePPE</a> to ask for help:</p>

    <p class="bigger embold">We need to help the helpers, right now.</p>

    <p class="bigger embold">We need to find the masks.</p>

    <p>Look in your basement, your emergency kit, your bug out bag, your workbench for <span class="embold">N95 masks</span>. They look like this:</p>

    <img src="n95.jpg" alt="three particulate respirator masks. The first is white with a filter cartridge on the front labelled &ldquo;3M NIOSH N100&rdquo;, the second is white with large black letters that say N95, the third is turquoise" class="visual pic"/>

    <p>All of these masks can save lives now if you get them into the hands of healthcare workers.</p>

    <p>If you find <span class="embold">surgical masks</span>, those are also in short supply, and in many places are being used in place of N95s. They look like this and can come in multiple colors.</p>

    <img src="surgical.jpg" alt="A blue surgical mask, it has multiple layers of material and ear loops" width="700" class="visual pic"/>

    <p>Disposable <span class=embold>booties</span>, <span class=embold>safety goggles</span>, and <span class=embold>disposable suits</span> are also in short supply. If you have these things or know someone who might (HVAC installers? Construction workers?) please share this site with them!</p>
