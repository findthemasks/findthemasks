              Each site is unique! Our request sites are looking for many kinds of equipment, including
              N95 masks, safety goggles, bunny suits, face shields, gowns, and disposable booties. Many
              sites have requested additional items such as hand sanitizer, thermometers, and
              walkie-talkies.
              Each listing has a complete list of items that they need, as well as whether they accept
              open packages or non-medical grade items. Refer to the card to see if you have something
              that a healthcare worker needs!
              Some sites have requested homemade masks and 3D-printed or makerspace items. If you are
              part of a makerspace community or can contribute homemade items, see our Makerspace
              Community FAQ.
