        Please use our map to help you identify frontline sites requesting PPE that will accept non-medical grade

        We are so glad you asked! FindtheMakers map was created to match community efforts and need. Please search
        within your local area. Makerspaces and maker groups have noted whether they are accepting volunteers. For those
        that are, please reach out using the contact method they provided. Spaces will need all types of volunteer
        support, including production and runners to make drop-offs.

        As much as our recipients need PPE, they must also manage the risk incurred by using
        non-medical grade items. Many institutions do not have the resources to vet all of the
        contributions they receive from various donors, and some are more comfortable only using
        the medical-grade items that they are familiar with and know they can rely on.

      <p class="i18n" data-i18n="ftm-faq-sites-non-medical-grade-answer-2">
        To ensure that your contributions are not wasted, please filter healthcare providers by "handmade" or
        "makerspace" items to locate the ones that can use your contribution!

        a national nonprofit supporting America’s maker organizations through community
        building, resource sharing, and advocacy, within the maker movement and beyond. Nation
        of Makers is supporting maker organizations during the COVID-19 crisis by connecting
        them to facilities that need PPE, identifying suppliers (and discounts) for maker
        groups fabricating PPE, and identifying funding sources for groups producing PPE. They
